### Details

In the insurance industry, a common workflow is processing customer claims. The end-to-end process involves several steps for both the customer and insurer. For example, imagine that a customer has purchased a car insurance policy. When their car is damaged, they must file a claim to request payment from the insurance company for repairs. The customer takes photos, describes the incident, and submits a claim to the insurance company. The insurance company receives the claim, validates the claim information, confirms itâ€™s covered by the policy, and determines the proper payment amount. Finally, the insurance company then distributes the payment to the appropriate parties.
