Fraud Detection
1. The fraud service accesses Customer and Claims tables to compare data from the processed document versus data provided by the customer during on-boarding. 
2. If thereâ€™s a mismatch then the fraud service emits a Fraud.Detected event with the fraud type included in the event payload back to the custom event bus. 
3. When no document fraud is detected, the service emits a Fraud.Not.Detected event.
